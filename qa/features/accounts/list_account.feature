Feature: Feel Accounts

  As a user
  I want to see details for my account
  So that I can validate my balance and other details

  Scenario: Ensure required accounts
    Given "thor" has a feel account with balance 100 F39 tokens
    Given "loki" has a feel account with balance 100 F39 tokens
    And "loki" has a account with second signature
    Given "odin" has a feel account with balance 100 F39 tokens
    And "odin" has a account registered as delegate
    Given "heimdall" has a feel account with balance 100 F39 tokens
    And "heimdall" creates a multisignature account with "thor", "odin"

  Scenario: List accounts
    When I look for list of accounts without any params
    Then I should get list of accounts sorted by "balance" in "asc" order
    When I search for a particular account "16313739661670634666L"
    Then I should get my account details

  Scenario Outline: List account
    When I look for list of account with "<params>"
    Then I should get account details according to "<params>"

  Scenario: Searches multisignature groups for a specific address .

    Then "heimdall" should get "multisignature_groups" account

  Scenario: List all members belonging to a particular multisignature group.
